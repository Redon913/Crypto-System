# Crypto-System

This is simple Crypto-system that I created for my summer-traning 2020.

# How to run

1. You must have python installed on your PC.  
**if not**  
Download and install by clicking [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Open [Front.py](https://github.com/Redon913/Crypto-System/blob/master/Front.py) in your code editor and run the file.  
**OR**  
Open cmd/Terminal in the directory where you kept the file on your system and run the command:  
`python ./Front.py`
